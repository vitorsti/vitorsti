## Hello there ! My name is Gino!

## About Me
I am a passionate 🎮 Game Developer and designer currently working with Unity and studying games since 2019. Over time, I have built all kinds of projects, from 2D platformers to FPS games. In all of my projects, I always use Game Development Documents (GDD) to plan and create new design ideas, thereby making the development process a lot easier. Additionally, I tend to create new games that can, in some way, build upon what I created in other projects, so every time I build a game, it's the best version I can produce.

## 💭 Hobbies
During my free time, I study and develop games. You can check out my series of video analyses and gameplays on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xCxcNPoTy4&list=PLT_ZYR2XRy9y_qtUqy2hRLOOrA2_2oHA-&index=17) where I not only share my opinions but also demonstrate how I would implement features in a different and improved way for the player. Additionally, I actively participate in game jams to enhance my game development skills, and you can view my projects [here](https://ginocarlo01.itch.io/).
